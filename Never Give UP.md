Problem in this code was coming when i downloaded this project from github problem was coming that after entering email id  & room no when i click on join button it was not working 

thoughts coming at that point in my mind that lets give up coding is not for me 
i tried a lot but nothing was happeing (4 pm to 5 pm)


then in between 5 pm to 6pm instead of learning code of differnt file  and solving it myself i dicussed this problem with chatgpt in brief he suggested me to try 5 ,6 solutions and thanked me 

& send me this message Perfect bhai, tu ne kaafi clear bata diya problem. Ab mai tujhe step-by-step le jaata hoon so we can debug and fix this:

he gave this first solution 
âœ… Step 1: Check Console (Browser)
Browser me http://localhost:5173 open kar.

F12 dabake Console tab khol.

Join button pe click kar.

Dekh koi error aaya kya? (like: socket is undefined, Cannot read properties of undefined, etc.)

ðŸŸ¢ Agar error dikhe â€” mujhe bhej de.
ðŸ”´ Agar kuch bhi nahi ho raha â€” next step pe ja.


i tried this solution asked to chatgpt  and the probelm got solved 

smart work+never give up 



problem was ---- frontend & backend was not working together
